General
=======

* we try to use material design
* the user must have feedback for the actions it performs (e.g. long click actions must give a clear
response about what it will do)

Colors
======

* Icon bar icons - it must use the same color as the text, i.e. the value in `colorToolbarTitle`.
Right now this value is `#FAFAFA`.
